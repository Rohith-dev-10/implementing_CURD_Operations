# Service CRM - My First Django Project 🚀

Welcome to my first ever GitHub repository! This project is a **simple and basic** Django-based **Service CRM** (Customer Relationship Management) application that I've built as part of my journey to learn backend development. 🌱

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project uses **Django** and **MySQL** to manage customers, service requests, and technicians. It provides **CRUD** (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, allowing you to perform basic actions on the system, such as adding and managing customers, tracking service requests, and assigning technicians to those requests.

### Why this project? 🤔
This project marks a major milestone for me—**my first Django project and my first repository**! 🎉 It's been an exciting learning experience, and I've added every feature step-by-step to build something functional and easy to understand. My aim was to create something **clean, simple**, and **basic** that can serve as the foundation for more complex applications down the road.

## ⚙️ Features

- **Customer Management:** Store and manage customer details like name, email, phone, and address.
- **Service Requests:** Create and manage service requests with attributes such as title, description, status, and priority.
- **Technician Management:** Assign technicians to service requests based on their skills and contact details.
- **Django ORM Integration:** All data handling is done through Django's Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) system for smooth database interactions.

## 🌟 Technologies Used

- **Django:** The Python web framework that powers the backend of this application.
- **MySQL:** The database used to store customer, service request, and technician data.
- **HTML/CSS:** For creating simple views and frontend elements.

📚 Learning Journey
Building this project was an amazing experience as I learned many things about backend development and web frameworks. From setting up a Django project to connecting it with MySQL and implementing CRUD operations—I’ve learned so much! This project represents my dedication to improving my development skills and taking on challenges head-on.

## A Big Milestone 🎯
This repository is special to me because it marks the beginning of my journey as a developer. It's my first project on GitHub and my first Django application. I couldn't be more excited to share it with the world, and I hope to continue improving and adding more features to it. 🌟
